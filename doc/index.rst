========================================================

This application is aimed at DMFT calculations with 
realistic band structure calculations. 
A priori TRIQS can be connected to various realistic band structure codes.
In this release, we provide the dft_tools extension module which contains an 
interface to the `Wien2k package <http://www.wien2k.at>`_.
