Authors & Quotation
=======================

The developement of an interface between the Wien2k electronic structure
package and TRIQS has been motivated by a scientific collaboration between the
research groups of Antoine Georges, Silke Biermann (Ecole Polytechnique),
Olivier Parcollet (CEA Saclay).  A first step has been the definition of the
framework and the construction of the projective Wannier functions as input for
the DMFT calculations [#wien2k1]_.  This has been followed by the introduction
of full charge self-consistency [#wien2k2]_, necessary for total energy
calculations.
